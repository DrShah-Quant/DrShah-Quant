- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/PeriodBigPlayers"> Period Big Players </a></b></br>
  <b>This Python program analyzes stock market tick data and visualizes transactions and volumes to help traders identify potential signs of large order activity over time.</b></br>
- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/PeriodBigPlayersCandlesticks"> Period Big Players With Japanese Candlestic Chart </a></b></br>
  <b>This Python program analyzes volume and transaction patterns alongside Japanese candlestick price action for a specific stock, using historical tick data.</b>
- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/DailyBigPlayerCandlestickRankTransformed"> Daily Big Players With Japanese Candlestic Chart </a></b></br>
  <b>The program computes the volume-to-outstanding shares ratio based on all daily transactions (including buys and sells). It then outputs the number of buy and sell transactions exceeding a user-defined percentile threshold.</b>
- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/VolumeCompositionAtPrices">Volume Composition At Prices </a></b></br>
<b>This Python program visualizes the breakdown of trading volume by transaction type (sell, buy, and open) at each price point recorded during a trading day.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/VWMA-Based-Traction-Strength-Strategy"> VWMA-Based Traction Strength Strategy </a></b></br>
  <b>This trading strategy leverages the Volume-Weighted Moving Average (VWMA) to capture traction strength in price movements. By weighting prices based on trading volume, it identifies momentum with greater reliability, improving entry and exit decision-making in algorithmic trading.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/9-Day-Moving-Average-Strategy/tree/main"> Pattern-Based Trend Confirmation with 9-Day Moving Average Strategy </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy identifies trend patterns such as higher highs or lower lows and confirms them with the 9-day moving average. It aims to capture medium-term momentum by combining pattern recognition with moving average validation for more robust trading signals.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Pattern-Based-High-Low-Turning-Point-Detection"> Pattern-Based High-Low Turning Point Detection </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy detects local highs and lows in price movements by analyzing sequences of closing prices. It identifies potential reversal points (support and resistance zones) that traders can use to anticipate short-term buying or selling opportunities.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Reversal-Detection-and-Entry-Strategy-Using-Previous-Day-s-Open-Close-Dynamics"> Event-Driven Reversal Capture Strategy with NAV-Based Position Sizing </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy captures potential price reversals by analyzing the relationship between the previous day‚Äôs open and close prices. It integrates NAV-based position sizing to dynamically allocate capital, aiming to balance risk exposure and maximize returns in volatile market conditions.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Moving-Average-Crossover-Monitoring-Strategy"> Moving Average Crossover Logger Strategy </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy monitors and logs moving average crossovers between short-term and long-term moving averages. By systematically recording crossover events, it provides insights into momentum shifts, trend reversals, and potential trading signals for algorithmic execution.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Anchored-VWAP-Based-Uptrend-Breakout-Strategy"> Anchored VWAP-Based Uptrend Breakout Strategy </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy uses Anchored Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as a dynamic support/resistance benchmark. It identifies breakout opportunities during established uptrends when prices sustain above anchored VWAP levels, providing traders with systematic entries aligned with institutional buying footprints.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Adaptive-Anchored-VWAP-Breakout-with-Trend-Pattern-Confirmation"> Adaptive Anchored VWAP Breakout with Trend-Pattern Confirmation </a></b></br>
  <b>This advanced strategy combines Anchored VWAP breakout signals with trend-pattern confirmation techniques. By dynamically adapting to price action and validating breakouts through structural trend patterns, it seeks to improve the reliability of breakout entries and reduce false signals in volatile markets.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Adaptive-Anchored-VWAP-Breakout-with-Swing-Pattern-Slope-Confirmation"> Adaptive Anchored VWAP Breakout with Swing-Pattern Slope Confirmation </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy enhances anchored VWAP breakout logic by integrating swing-pattern slope confirmation. By requiring higher highs, higher lows, and slope-strength validation before breakouts, it filters weak signals, ensuring entries align with strong institutional trend momentum.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Anchored-VWAP-Swing-Low-Rebound-Strategy-with-Multi-Swing-Confirmation-and-Slope-Divergence-Exit"> Anchored VWAP Swing-Low Rebound Strategy with Multi-Swing Confirmation and Slope-Divergence Exit </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy builds on anchored VWAP swing-low rebound logic by requiring confirmation from multiple swing structures before entry. It integrates slope-divergence analysis to control exits, ensuring participation in high-quality trend continuations while reducing false signals and protecting profits when momentum weakens.</b>

- <b><a href="https://github.com/DrShah-Quant/Trend-Breakout-with-Volume-Weighted-Buy-Sell-Strategy"> Trend Breakout with Volume-Weighted Buy-Sell Strategy </a></b></br>
  <b>This strategy combines trend breakout detection with volume-weighted buy-sell execution. It identifies structural breakouts from macro trend lows/highs and validates entries with volume dynamics. The approach ensures disciplined buying during strong uptrends and triggers systematic exits on volume spikes or trend reversals.</b>
